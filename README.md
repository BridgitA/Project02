Giphy Search

For the giphy search we will start by creating a html file and adding a search engine and a submit button. Also, make sure to add another div for the gifs inside that div i created a class called inner for my gifs and another class for the flex container. Then moved on to js and created a get data function which will be help us everytime you search anything it will return the results that you searched for. I added my input and the api key where we will be pulling all the gifs from and finally created a for loop function that will append. To finish off I created the styles files that will do the design part for me. For the future improvements work on jquery more, i have the basics down but it would help if i dig a lot more deeper, always remember to watch sass everytime i use the scss i was forget to do that alot. Lastly, have fun with it because its a process and not stress much.
